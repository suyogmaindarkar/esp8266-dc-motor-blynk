# DC Motor Control using ESP8266 and Blynk

This file provides step-by-step instructions to replicate the project setup, including circuit connections, code upload, and Blynk configuration.

---

## 1. Circuit Connections

### Components Required:
- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- DC Motor
- Power Supply (Battery or Adapter)
- Jumper Wires

### Wiring Instructions:
- **Motor Driver IN1 → D1 (GPIO5) of ESP8266**
- **Motor Driver IN2 → D2 (GPIO4) of ESP8266**
- **Motor Driver ENA → 5V (via jumper or PWM pin if speed control needed)**
- **Motor Driver GND → GND of ESP8266**
- **Motor Driver VCC → External 12V Supply**
- **ESP8266 VIN → Motor Driver 5V (if using same power source)**

## 2. Code Upload

### Tools Required:
- Arduino IDE
- USB Cable for ESP8266

### Steps:
1. Open the `.ino` file provided in this repository.
2. Install ESP8266 Board via **Boards Manager**.
3. Install Blynk Library (via Library Manager).
4. Replace **YourAuthToken**, **WiFi SSID**, and **Password** in the code.
5. Select **NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)** as the board.
6. Click **Upload**.

## 3. Blynk Setup

### Steps:
1. Install the **Blynk IoT App** (Android/iOS).
2. Create a new project and note the **Auth Token** received via email.
3. Add a **Button Widget**:
   - Assign to **Virtual Pin V1**
   - Set mode to **Switch**
4. Link your device using the Auth Token in code.
5. Run the project and control motor via app.

## 4. Test & Output

- Slide the switch ON in Blynk app to rotate motor in one direction.
- Slide it OFF to rotate in the other direction (or stop, depending on logic).
- Adjust wiring/code for direction and speed control if needed.
